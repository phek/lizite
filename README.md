This project is currently in a very early state. The goal with this project is to try different new technologies, some of the things I want to try in this project are:
* AngularJS 6
* Continuous Integration (Using Jenkins)
* Google Material
* Redux (Using ngrx/store) 
* NodeJS
* MongoDB

I know some of these technologies are not optimal for a community website, the purpose of the project is **not** to create an optimal stack. Its purpose is to try new modern technologies, see how well they work together and see what pros and cons each technology have.
